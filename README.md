# Lexical-Analyzer-and-Syntax-Checker
Designed and implemented a Lexical Analyzer for a subset of the Pascal Programming Language. Your program should be able to accept as input a file containing statements in Pascal and correctly perform a lexical analysis of each statement. Then wrote a (limited) syntax check.
